# MindPath Learning Systems  
🎓 AI-Powered Prediction of Students' Math Scores  

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Business Analysis 3.2 (AIBUY3A)** module.  
Our goal is to build an **AI solution for the Education Industry** that predicts students’ math scores based on demographic, socio-economic, and academic factors.  

By leveraging machine learning, schools and higher learning institutions can identify at-risk students early and provide targeted interventions to improve learning outcomes.

## 📊 Dataset
We used the <a href="https://github.com/MindPath-Learning-Systems/MindPath-Learning-Systems/blob/main/StudentsPerformance.csv">Dataset</a> from Kaggle, which includes:  
- Gender  
- Race/Ethnicity  
- Parental Education Level  
- Lunch Type  
- Test Preparation Course  
- Math, Reading, and Writing Scores  

**Target Variable:** Math Score

## 🤖 Machine Learning Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle categorical variables (gender, lunch, etc.).  
   - Normalize and clean dataset.  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - R² Score  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
