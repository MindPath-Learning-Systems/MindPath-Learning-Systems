# MindPath Learning Systems  
🎓 AI-Powered Prediction of Students' Math Scores  

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Business Analysis 3.2 (AIBUY3A)** module.  
Our goal is to build an **AI solution for the Education Industry** that predicts students’ math scores based on demographic, socio-economic, and academic factors.  

By leveraging machine learning, schools and higher learning institutions can identify at-risk students early and provide targeted interventions to improve learning outcomes.
